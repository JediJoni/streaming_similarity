# Streaming Content Similarity & Genre Clustering

This project builds on the cleaned catalog metadata produced in the
[`streaming_analysis`](../streaming_analysis) project.

The goal is to explore **content similarity** and **genre structure**
across streaming platforms using interpretable, metadata-driven features
(genres, countries, cast overlap, runtime, etc.).

## Project focus

- Feature engineering from multi-label categorical metadata
- Interpretable similarity measures (before black-box embeddings)
- Genre diversity and clustering structure
- Foundations for a future content-based recommender system

## Status

🛠️ Initial setup  
🛠️ Feature design in progress
